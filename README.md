## Overview

This repository is a personal documentation library — a centralized place for technical references, development methodologies, and practical guides authored for real use. Guides are written for clarity and immediate applicability, not as theoretical exercises.

Content spans three domains: **version control** (Git/GitHub), **frontend development** (methodology and patterns), and **AI-augmented workflows** (vibe coding with LLMs). A bilingual Git guide (Arabic + English) is included as an interactive HTML experience.
